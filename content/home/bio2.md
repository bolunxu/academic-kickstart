## Shanghai

I started my undergraduate study at Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU) in 2007, 
where I enrolled in the joint institute (JI) with University of Michigan (UM). 
I spent my first two years there, and then I was transfered to UM as part of 
the dual bachelor degree program. 

## Ann Arbor

At Ann Arbor my primary direction was on embedded system design, but I first learned about 
the power industry from courses given by Prof. Ian Hiskens and Prof. Heath Hofmann. And interestingly,
I accidentally ran into a seminar given by Prof. Goran Andersson from ETH Zurich where I learned about 
the school and the group, a coincidence that changed my life course. I obtained my BS in 
electrical engineering from UM in Jan 2011.

## Zurich

After returning to Shanghai and finishing my degree requirement there, 
I moved to ETH Zurich for my master study in September 2011. I finished my first semester project in the Power System Lab (PSL)
on dynamic line rating, and my second semester project was in the power electronic system lab (PES) on 
real-time monitoring system design. 

I started my internship at ABB Corporate Research Center in Baden-Datwill in June 2012, where I worked 
with Dr. Marija Zima on the Active Distribution network with 
full integration of Demand and distributed energy RESourceS (ADDRESS) project. 
After my internship, I continued in ABB with my master thesis supervised by Dr. Alexandre Oudalov 
and Dr. Andreas Ulbig from PSL, the topic was on modeling 
battery degradation and design operation strategies for frequency control. 
My thesis was examined by Prof. Goran Andersson.

During my time at ETH and ABB, I became very interested in power system research, 
and eventually decided to pursue my PhD in University of Washington (UW).


## Beijing
After earning my master degree in February 2014, I spent my gap time as a research intern in 
China Electric Power Research Institute. I worked on wave power generations
where we used wave animation models to estimate wave power from weather, it was a very interesting approach.
After spending my summer at Beijing, I moved to Seattle for my PhD study in September 2014. 

## Seattle
I joined Prof. Daniel Kirschen's research group and later 
I invited Prof. Baosen Zhang to be my co-advisor. 
My PhD time was
