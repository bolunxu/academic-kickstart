# About me

I am a postdoctoral associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 
I am affiliated with [MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI)](http://energy.mit.edu/) 
and [Lab for Info. and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/), hosted by
[Dr. Francis O'Sullivan](http://energy.mit.edu/profile/francis-osullivan/) 
and [Dr. Audun Botterud](http://botterud.mit.edu/). 

I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering from University of Washington, Seattle, adviserd by
[Prof. Daniel Kirschen](http://labs.ece.uw.edu/real/real_pe.html) and 
[Prof. Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). 
My dissertation is on optimal market participation for battery energy storage and you can find it
[here](https://labs.ece.uw.edu/real/Library/Thesis/Bolun.pdf). 
Prior to my PhD, I received my master degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich and 
my [master thesis](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=0816675AAAFFFB44F5C0BD800A5DCECA?doi=10.1.1.701.3320&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
