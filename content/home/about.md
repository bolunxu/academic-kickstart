# About me

I am a postdoctoral associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
My position is affiliated with [MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI)](http://energy.mit.edu/) 
and [Lab for Info. and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/), hosted by
[Dr. Francis O'Sullivan](http://energy.mit.edu/profile/francis-osullivan/) 
and [Dr. Audun Botterud](http://botterud.mit.edu/). 
My CV is [here](files/Xu_CV.pdf).

I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering from University of Washington, Seattle, advised by
[Prof. Daniel Kirschen](http://labs.ece.uw.edu/real/real_pe.html) and 
[Prof. Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). 
My dissertation is [here](https://labs.ece.uw.edu/real/Library/Thesis/Bolun.pdf).
