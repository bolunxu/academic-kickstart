I traveled many places during my career and am fortunate to have worked with many great researchers. 
I have arranged my experience based on the cities I lived.

I started my undergrad in Shanghai Jiaotong University ([SJTU](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)) in September 2007 
and received my BS degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in August 2011.


## Ann Arbor

I transfered to University of Michigan ([UM](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/)), Ann Arbor in 
September 2009 as part of a joint [dual-degree program](http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/about/).
I received my BS degree in Electrical Engineering from UM in January 2011.

## Zurich

I started my master on power systems and power electronics in [ETH Zurich](https://www.ee.ethz.ch/)
 in September 2011 and
received my master degree in Electrical Engineering in February 2014.

## Dättwil

During my study at ETH I was a research intern at ABB Corporate Research Center in Baden-Dättwil. 
where I worked with [Dr. Marija Zima-Bockarjova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marija-zima-bockarjova-683a834/)
on [an active demand project]({{< ref "publication/xu_address2013/index.md" >}}).

my [thesis](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.701.3320) 
on battery energy storage was examined by
[Prof. Göran Andersson](https://www.ethz.ch/content/specialinterest/itet/institute-eeh/psl-ee/en/people/professors-emeritus/Em%20Prof-Dr-Goeran-Andersson.html). 


## Beijing
I spent my 2014 summer in Beijing as a research intern in China Electric Power Research Institute
where I worked on [wave power generation]({{< ref "publication/he_economic2015/index.md" >}}). .

## Seattle
From September 2014 to June 2018 I was a PhD student at 
[University of Washington](https://www.ece.uw.edu/)
