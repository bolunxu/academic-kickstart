My research proposes algorithms and market designs 
towards an economic, reliable, and sustainable power system. 
I'm particularly interested in the following topics.

## A Future with Energy Storage

Energy storage offsets renewable fluctuations and is the key to a low-carbon future,
but managing these assets at the system level remains an open question. 
Operators must make real-time dispatch decisions to mitigate instantaneous imbalances,
but also need to consider the value of stored energy in the future. 
Shaping future insights into a computation-viable 
form is a challenge that requires efficient operation algorithms and advanced data analytic tools.


## Individuals in the System

A power system is more than a physical infrastructure, it interconnects millions of individuals 
with different roles and objectives. 
A household with roof-top PV is both a consumer and a producer, 
but might not be an active market participant.
Merchants like energy storage and financial entities are neither consumer nor producer, 
but they contribute flexibilities and liquidities that aid power system operations. 
Analyzing individual objectives and 
looping their behavior into the system design is of great importance. 

## Re-imagining Power System

With more inertia-free and distributed resources, the power system is transforming from 
a centralized sequential-stage scheme into a hierarchical structure 
with autonomous local agents and aggregations. This transformation poses a series of interesting
research questions such as designing new market flexibility products and interfacing local aggregations
with the wholesale market.
